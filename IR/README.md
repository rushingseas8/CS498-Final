## IR

This file contains the debugging and implementation code for the IR portion.

I got it to work on the Nano Every, but soldering issues led to the Teensey 2.0 not being able to use this code fully. Thus, this code is stuck on debug mode. However, there are methods that can be used when the hardware does eventually get fixed.
