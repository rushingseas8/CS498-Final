## Keyboard

Turns out, the Nano Every _claims_ to have HID support, but in reality lacks a dedicated USB chip, and so cannot act as a native keyboard.

The Teensey 2.0 was correct in its advertisements, and can run this code no problem. I tested it and it can control media controls using the created methods on my Windows 10 PC.
